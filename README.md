### Fun project based on the BoardGame - NotAlone

#### Game info

NOT ALONE is an asymetrical card game, with one player (the Creature) playing against other players (the Hunted).

If you play as one of the Hunted, you explore Artemia using Place cards. By playing these and your Survival cards, your aim is to avoid being hunted down by the Creature until help arrives.

If you play as the Creature, your aim is to hunt down the shipwrecked survivors and assimilate them into the planet's ecosystem. By playing your Hunt cards and activating the powers of Artemia, you repeatedly attack the Hunted to wear down their will and inescapably bind them to the planet.
